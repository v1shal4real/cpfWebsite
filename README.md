# CPF Projection Tool

A browser-based tool that projects how Singapore CPF balances evolve over a
working lifetime, and shows what a housing decision costs in retirement terms.

Illustrative projections only. Not financial advice.

## Stack

React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, Recharts. No backend;
all computation runs client-side.
